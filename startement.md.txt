Project Statement: Gradient Calculator Web App● Problem StatementStandard calculator applications often prioritize pure utility over user experience, resulting in bland, uninspiring interfaces that can feel outdated or clinical. Users interacting with web-based tools desire interfaces that are not only functional but also visually engaging and responsive. There is a need for a calculator that combines essential arithmetic functions with a modern, aesthetic design language that enhances the visual appeal of simple computing tasks.● Scope of the ProjectThe project involves the development of the front-end interface for a web-based calculator. The scope is focused on:Visual Design: Implementing a "glass-morphism" inspired look with pill-shaped buttons and a vibrant gradient background (Purple to Cyan).Layout Engineering: Utilizing CSS absolute positioning to create a centered, floating interface that works on standard web viewports.Interactive Styling: defining visual feedback states (hover effects) for operator buttons to improve usability.Typography: Establishing a clear hierarchy using sans-serif fonts with varying weights for headers (`h1`, `h2`) and input controls (`.button`, `#display`).● Target UsersStudents & Learners: Individuals looking for a simple tool to perform basic calculations with a clean interface.Web Design Enthusiasts: Developers or designers seeking examples of CSS-only styling, specifically for gradients and border-radius manipulation.General Web Users: Anyone needing quick access to basic arithmetic functions without the clutter of complex scientific calculators.● High-Level FeaturesModern Gradient Interface: A full-screen background transitioning from `#7808f0` (Purple) to `#06bdf5` (Blue).Floating Centered Design: The main calculator body (`.calcic`) is centered dynamically using absolute positioning and transform translations.Custom Keypad Layout:Uniform circular keys (`.button`, `.operator`) sized at 55px with a smooth 30px border radius.A dedicated, wider "Zero" key (`#zero`) for standard calculator ergonomic layouts.Interactive Operator Keys: Action buttons (like +, -, *, /) feature a distinct hover state that shifts the background color to cyan (`#00d9ff`).Clear Output Display: A stylized input/output screen (`#display`) with a white background and specific dimensions for high visibility.
